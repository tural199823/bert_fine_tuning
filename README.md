Fine-Tuning BERT with LoRa for Sequence Classification

This project focuses on fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sequence classification, leveraging LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. The dataset used originates from the AG News dataset curated by fancyzhx (fancyzhx/ag_news).

Dependencies:

For seamless execution in Colab, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

bash

!pip install transformers datasets torch
!pip install -q -U bitsandbytes
!pip install transformers[torch] accelerate -U
!pip install -q evaluate
!pip install peft

Libraries:

    ðŸ¤— Transformers: Crucial for fine-tuning and deploying NLP models.
    ðŸ¤— Datasets: Provides access to various datasets, including AG News.
    ðŸ¤— Accelerate: Enables efficient experimentation with distributed training.
    bitsandbytes: Utilized for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) techniques.
    evaluate: Helpful for evaluating model performance.
    peft: Package for Pre-Training Encoder-Free Transformers (PEFT).

Usage:

    Import required libraries and dependencies.
    Load the AG News dataset using load_dataset from datasets.
    Prepare the BERT model for training using prepare_model_for_kbit_training.
    Fine-tune the BERT model for sequence classification using Trainer from transformers.
    Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance using appropriate metrics.

By following these steps, you can efficiently fine-tune BERT for sequence classification tasks using LoRa techniques.
