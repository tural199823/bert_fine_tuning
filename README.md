Fine-Tuning BERT with LoRa for Sequence Classification

This project focuses on fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sequence classification, leveraging LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. The dataset used originates from the AG News dataset curated by fancyzhx (fancyzhx/ag_news).

Dependencies:

For seamless execution in Colab, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    ðŸ¤— Transformers: Crucial for fine-tuning and deploying NLP models.
    ðŸ¤— Datasets: Provides access to various datasets, including AG News.
    ðŸ¤— Accelerate: Enables efficient experimentation with distributed training.
    bitsandbytes: Utilized for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) techniques.
    evaluate: Helpful for evaluating model performance.
    peft: Package for Pre-Training Encoder-Free Transformers (PEFT).

Libraries:

    !pip install transformers datasets torch
    !pip install -q -U bitsandbytes
    !pip install transformers[torch] accelerate -U
    !pip install -q evaluate
    !pip install peft
    import re
    import bitsandbytes
    from datasets import load_dataset
    import transformers
    import accelerate
    from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training, LoraConfig, get_peft_model, PeftModel
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig, AutoTokenizer
    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
    from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

Usage:

    1. Import required libraries and dependencies.
    2. Load the AG News dataset using load_dataset from datasets.
    3. Prepare the BERT model for training using prepare_model_for_kbit_training.
    4. Fine-tune the BERT model for sequence classification using Trainer from transformers.
    5. Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance using appropriate metrics.
